                <div class="intro-text">The Color Makeup machine was my first major independent project. Inspired by an
                    art analysis I was doing on the artist Maria Prymachenko, I wanted to create a program that took in
                    an image or a collection of pictures and returned a statistical representation of the colors within
                    those images. The program primarily uses two libraries to function. First, the visual component is
                    run with Pygame; I used Pygame as it was a simple visual program with many online tutorials. The
                    primary purpose of this program was color processing, not aesthetics, so Pygame was perfect. For
                    color processing, I used the Python Imaging Library (PIL); this program got the RBG values from all
                    of the pixels.</div>

                <div class="example-text">
                    The image to the right of this shows an example output from the program. The graphing program I
                    used,
                    provided mant options which I made available to the user to customize the graph to their
                    specifications. As well, primary for the purpose of dubugging but also as an extra feature, if the
                    user inputted only one image an image composed of only the colors recognized would be outputted,
                    this allows the user to see what colors were being recognized. Suprisingly enough, one of the most
                    difficult parts of this program was defining colors, as other than the simple red, green and blue of
                    RGB colors the line at which one color becomes another is rather subjective and difficult to define.
                    Through meticulus trial and error I eventually had the program recognizing all the colors I wished
                    it too, though this part could definitly use some tweaking.

                    The video to the left of this shows an example of the program running. There are endless
                    improvements I would like to do this program, both visually and mechanically, but I must move on. I
                    am super happy with how the program turned out, it is able to do exactly what it was designed for,
                    process the color makup of images. As well, it is able to function with a massive ammount of data,
                    meaning it will work for artists whole catologs.
