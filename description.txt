Hello my name is Marki I come from a far away land full of lots and lots of money. Come follow me! Let me lead you to your billions. I am made from one markov chain full of over a million 5 day chunks of three values high to low percent change, open to close percent change, and the volume of buys for the day. Using that data and the data feed through two neural nets I am able to somewhat accurately predict the stock market sometimes. The chi squared determines how well I predict the data. We reject the null hypothesis(we confirm that I know what I am doing) if the p-value is less than the significance level (typically 0.05 or 0.005).
